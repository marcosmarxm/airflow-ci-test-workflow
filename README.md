# Airflow Testing with CI workflow

This code is complementar to my article [How to build a DataOps enviroment with Airflow (Part 1): setup CI/CD and DAG pipelineÂ tests](https://medium.com/@marcosmarxm/how-to-build-a-dataops-enviroment-with-airflow-part-1-setup-ci-cd-and-dag-pipeline-tests-13cdf050439e).
I suggest you to read to better understand the code and the way I think how to setup the project.
